score = float(input())
Reads the score of the student and converts it to a floating-point number.

alist.append([name, score])
Adds a pair [name, score] as a sublist to alist.

second_highest = sorted(set([score for name, score in alist]))[1]
List comprehension: [score for name, score in alist] extracts all the scores from alist.
set(): Converts the list of scores into a set, which removes duplicate scores.
sorted(): Sorts the unique scores in ascending order.
[1]: Accesses the second element in the sorted list, which will be the second highest unique score.

print('\n'.join(sorted([name for name, score in alist if score == second_highest])))
List comprehension: [name for name, score in alist if score == second_highest] creates a list of names whose score is equal to the second_highest score.
sorted(): Sorts the names alphabetically.
'\n'.join(...): Joins the sorted names with a newline character (\n), so each name appears on a new line when printed.
